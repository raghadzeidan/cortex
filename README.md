# first_project
Welcome to the Github page of the Advanced System Design project by Raghad Zeidan.
Quickstart explanation:
  The final project includes a client, which streams cognition snapshots to a server, 
  which then publishes them to a message queue, where multiple parsers read the snapshot,
  parse various parts of it, and publish the parsed results, which are then saved to a database.
  The result in the database is then reflected by an API, CLI and GUI.
